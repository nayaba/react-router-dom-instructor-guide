# ![React Router DOM - Setup](./assets/hero.png)

## Setup

Open your Terminal application and navigate to your **`~/code/ga/lectures`** directory:

```bash
cd ~/code/ga/lectures
```

Create a new Vite project for your React app:

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

You'll be prompted to choose a project name. Let's name it `react-router-dom`.

- Select a framework. Use the arrow keys to choose the `React` option and hit `Enter`.

- Select a variant. Again, use the arrow keys to choose `JavaScript` and hit `Enter`.

Navigate to your new project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd react-router-dom
npm i
```

Open the project's folder in your code editor:

```bash
code .
```

### Configuring ESLint

Before we begin, we need to adjust the ESLint configuration. Add the following rules to the `.eslintrc.cjs` file:

```js
rules: {
  'react-refresh/only-export-components': [
    'warn',
    { allowConstantExport: true },
  ],
  'react/prop-types': 'off', // add this line
  'react/no-unescaped-entities': 'off' // add this line
},
```

The first addition prevents warnings if you're not declaring types for your props (which we're not), and the second prevents warnings if you're using contractions within JSX.

### Clear `App.jsx`

Open the `App.jsx` file in the `src` directory and replace the contents of it with the following:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

const App = () => {
  return <h1>Hello world!</h1>;
};

export default App;
```

### Running the development server

To start the development server and view our app in the browser, we'll use the following command: 

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see that `Vite` is available on port number 5173: 

```plaintext
localhost:5173
```

### GitHub setup

To add this project to GitHub, initialize a Git repository:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "init commit"
```

Make a new repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/) named react-router-dom. 

Link your local project to your remote GitHub repo:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<github-username>/react-router-dom.git
git push origin main
```

> 🚨 Do not copy the above command. It will not work. Your GitHub username will replace `<github-username>` (including the `<` and `>`) in the URL above.

## Getting started

Since this lesson is going to involve switching between components, let's keep things organized by creating a `components` folder at the root level of the `src` directory:

```bash
cd src
mkdir components
```

Create a new component called `PokemonList`:

```bash
touch components/PokemonList.jsx
```

Add the following starter code to `src/components/PokemonList.jsx`:

```jsx
const PokemonList = (props) => {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Pokemon</h2>
      <ul>
        {props.pokemon.map((currentPokemon) => (
          <li key={currentPokemon.name}>{currentPokemon.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
};

export default PokemonList;
```

Open `src/App.jsx` and replace its contents with the following:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import PokemonList from './components/PokemonList';

const initialState = [
  { _id: 1, name: 'bulbasaur', weight: 69, height: 7 },
  { _id: 2, name: 'ivysaur', weight: 130, height: 10 },
  { _id: 3, name: 'venusaur', weight: 1000, height: 20 },
  { _id: 4, name: 'charmander', weight: 85, height: 6 },
  { _id: 5, name: 'charmeleon', weight: 190, height: 11 },
];

const App = () => {
  const [pokemon, setPokemon] = useState(initialState);
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Pokemon!</h1>
      <PokemonList pokemon={pokemon} />
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
```
