# ![React Router DOM - Route Parameters](./assets/hero.png)

**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to define and access URL parameters with React Router.

## Route parameters in React Router

At the moment, our application has static paths like `/` or `/pokemon`. In this section, we'll introduce dynamic segments to our URLs, enabling paths like `/pokemon/1`. To do so, we'll make use of route parameters, as well as a special hook for accessing route parameters in React Router.

Route parameters are dynamic segments of a URL, used to store data within the URL path. In React Router, these parameters allow our applications to dynamically display content based on the current URL. In our app, we'll store the `_id` of a pokemon in the URL, and access this `_id` to render the corresponding pokemon on its own page.

## Create dynamic links

First, let's turn each pokemon name into a clickable link within the `<PokemonList />`.

Import the `Link` component at the top of `PokemonList.jsx`:

```jsx
// src/components/PokemonList.jsx

import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
```

Next, wrap the text content of the `<li>` with a `<Link>`:

```jsx
// src/components/PokemonList.jsx

<li key={currentPokemon.name}>
  <Link to={`/pokemon/${currentPokemon._id}`}>
    {currentPokemon.name}
  </Link>
</li>
```

Notice how we have defined the value of the `to` prop here. With this, each `<Link>` receives a dynamically generated path (`/pokemon/2` for example).

### Gotta catch 'em all route

At this point, clicking on one of these links will result in a blank page underneath the app-wide "Pokemon!" header. This is because none of the routes defined in the `<Routes>` component match the pattern of `/pokemon/id`, and you'll see a warning in the browser console letting us know what's going wrong.

To prevent this behavior, you can define a **default route** inside the `App.jsx` `<Routes>` component, and add it to the bottom of the list of `<Route>` components:

```jsx
<Route path='/' element={<h2>Home Page</h2>} />
<Route path='/pokemon' element={<PokemonList pokemon={pokemon} />}></Route>
// NEW, CATCH-ALL DEFAULT ROUTE
<Route path="*" element={<h2>Whoops, nothing here!</h2>} />
```

## Defining dynamic routes

Next, we'll create a route that matches these dynamic links. For this, we'll also need a new component that renders the details of a single pokemon.

Create a new component called `PokemonDetails`:

```bash
touch src/components/PokemonDetails.jsx
```

Add the following to `src/components/PokemonDetails.jsx`:

```jsx
// src/components/PokemonDetails.jsx

const PokemonDetails = (props) => {
  console.log(props); // Always verify that any props are being passed correctly!
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Pokemon Details</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt>Weight:</dt>
        <dd></dd>
        <dt>Height:</dt>
        <dd></dd>
      </dl>
    </>
  );
};

export default PokemonDetails;
```

Import the new component at the top of `src/App.jsx`:

import

```jsx
// src/App.jsx
import PokemonDetails from './components/PokemonDetails';
```

And finally, update the `<Routes/>` component of the `<App/>` component like so:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<h2>Home Page</h2>} />
  <Route path="/pokemon" element={<PokemonList pokemon={pokemon} />} />
  <Route
    path="/pokemon/:pokemonId"
    element={<PokemonDetails pokemon={pokemon} />}
  />
</Routes>
```

Take a moment to review the syntax of our new dynamic `<Route>`.

In React Router, route parameters are defined in the `path` using a `:` symbol. Here, we have defined a `pokemonId` route parameter. When a user selects a pokemon link, the URL changes to include that pokemon's `_id_`, which is captured by the `pokemonId` parameter.

In short, this new `<Route>` tells React Router to render `<PokemonDetails />` for URLs following the pattern `/pokemon/1`, `/pokemon/2`, `/pokemon/3`, etc.

> ðŸ’¡ Notice how we are we passing the `pokemon` array to `<PokemonDetails />`. In the next section, we'll use this array combined with our `pokemonId` route parameter to locate and render a specific pokemon in the array.

## Accessing dynamic parameters with `useParams()`

With the route in place, you should now be able to navigate to the details page.

Notice the `_id` value stored in the URL bar of the details page. We'll need this value to find a specific pokemon object in the `props.pokemon` array. To do so, we'll make use of React Router's `useParams()` hook.

The `useParams()` hook returns an object with properties for each route parameter in the current URL. With this hook, we can store data in the URL, and extract it for use in a component.

![Extracting data with `useParams()`](./assets/useparams.png)

The hook can be applied in a component like this:

```jsx
const params = useParams();
console.log(params);
```

In `PokemonDetails.jsx`, the object returned from `useParams()` might look like this:

```js
{
  pokemonId: '1';
}
```

Additionally, the `useParams()` hook can take advantage of object destructuring:

```jsx
const { pokemonId } = useParams();
console.log(pokemonId); // Expected output: '1'
```

Let's apply this pattern in `PokemonDetails.jsx`.

Add the following import at the top of `src/App.jsx`:

```jsx
// src/components/PokemonDetails.jsx

import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';
```

And add the following lines to the component before the `return` value:

```jsx
// src/components/PokemonDetails.jsx

const { pokemonId } = useParams();
console.log('pokemonId:', pokemonId);
```

Try navigating to the details page once again, and verify that you are able to access the `pokemonId` route parameter.

## Rendering the data

Our last task is to `find()` a specific pokemon in the `props.pokemon` array using the extracted `pokemonId`.

Update the main function of `PokemonDetails.jsx` with the following:

```jsx
// src/components/PokemonDetails.jsx

const PokemonDetails = (props) => {
  const { pokemonId } = useParams();
  const singlePokemon = props.pokemon.find((poke) => poke._id === Number(pokemonId));
  console.log('Pokemon Object:', singlePokemon)

```

Note the use of the `Number` function to ensure the route parameter is typecast from its original `String` data type to the `Number` type we expect an `_id` property to have. Route parameters will always start with a `String` datatype, so be careful when making comparisons with them!

Once you verify the `singlePokemon` data, update the `return` with the following:

```jsx
// src/components/PokemonDetails.jsx
return (
  <>
    <h2>{singlePokemon.name}</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Weight:</dt>
      <dd>{singlePokemon.weight}</dd>
      <dt>Height:</dt>
      <dd>{singlePokemon.height}</dd>
    </dl>
  </>
);
```

Test this functionality in your browser. When you click on a link, you should see details on the corresponding pokemon.
